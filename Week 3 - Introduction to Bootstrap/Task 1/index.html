                <p>Sophmore QB Drake Maye continues to impress after the Patriots 2-game winning streak was extended against the New Orleans Saints.</p>
                <p>Maye had a particularly impressive connection with third-year receiver Kayshon Boutte who caught 5 receptions for 96 yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 25-19 win.</p>
                <p>Boutte and Maye connected on a late-game catch along the Patriots sideline which, after a Mike Vrabel challenge, was ruled complete in bounds sealing the win for the Patriots after Desmond Ridder's Saints started to mount consecutive scoring drives.</p>
                <p>The New England Patriots offense under new offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels has been much improved compared to last year under first-time-OC Alex Van Pelt.</p>
                <p>One of the big criticisms so far of the Patrios 25/26 Offense has been limited playtime for rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson and rookie receiver Kyle Williams.</p>
                <p>Williams was a shrine-bowl standout with elite twitch off the line and true downfield speed. McDaniels' offense however, has been historically difficult for rookie receivers to get to grips with due to the reliance on choice routes and QB-WR chemistry.</p>

                <p>Maye and Diggs connected for a season-high 10 catches for a total of 146 receiving yards (14.6 average yards per catch) against the Bills secondary, who were boosted by the return of star Linebacker Matt Milano. </p>
