    <h2>Why should I visit Athens?</h2>

    <p>
        Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. A significant coastal urban area in the Mediterranean, Athens is also the capital of the Attica region and is the southernmost capital on the European mainland. 
        With its urban area's population numbering over 3.6 million, it is the eighth-largest urban area in the European Union (EU).
        Athens is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence beginning somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BCE. According to Greek mythology the city was named after Athena, the ancient Greek goddess of wisdom, but modern scholars generally agree that the goddess took her name after the city.

        It was a centre for democracy, the arts, education and philosophy, and was highly influential throughout the European continent, particularly in >Ancient Rome. For this reason it is often regarded as the cradle of Western civilisation and the birthplace of democracy in its own right independently from the rest of Greece.
        The heritage of the Classical Era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments, and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western culture. Athens retains Roman, Byzantine and a smaller number of Ottoman monuments, while its historical urban core features elements of continuity through its millennia of history. Athens contains two World Heritage Sites recognised by UNESCO: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens" title="Wikipedia Article for the Acropolis">Acropolis of Athens</a> and the medieval <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphni_Monastery" title="Wikipedia Article for the Daphni Monastery">Daphni Monastery</a>.
