<h1>Beaches!</h1>


<p><a href="http://www.sunderland.ac.ukk">Sunderland is a city</a> by the sea: our Sir Tom Cowie Campus at St Peter&rsquo;s is a 10 minute walk from miles of beautiful sandy beach.<br>
  <br>
  Seaburn beach is one of the finest beaches in the North East. With long stretches of sand and a mile-long promenade, it's the perfect place to unwind. <br>
